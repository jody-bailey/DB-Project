# CSC-411 Course Project

This project is for CSC-411 Databases at the University of Southern Mississippi.

### How to run the application

1. In a terminal/CMD prompt, navigate to where you would like the code stored.
2. Enter command `git clone https://github.com/jody-bailey/DB-Project.git`
   Optional: You may also rename the project locally by doing `git clone https://github.com/jody-bailey/DB-Project.git [NAME GOES HERE]`
3. Now, `cd DB-Project`
4. Then, `npm install` to install the necessary node module dependencies.
5. Finally, run `npm run server.js`

Using your favorite API endpoint checker, e.g. Postman, make a request to `http://localhost:3000/seeddb`. This will seed the database with the necessary data for the project. (You may also use a browser for this but will only receive a JSON object back as a response.)

You will now be able to navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your favorite browser to view the application.
